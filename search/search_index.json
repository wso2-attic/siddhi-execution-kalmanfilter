Using the extension as a java library This extension can be added as a maven dependency along with other Siddhi dependencies to your project. dependency groupId org.wso2.extension.siddhi.execution.kalmanfilter /groupId artifactId siddhi-execution-kalman-filter /artifactId version x.x.x /version /dependency Jenkins Build Status Branch Build Status master Features kalmanFilter ( Function ) This extension provides Kalman filtering capabilities to Siddhi. This allows you to detect outliers of input data. This function uses measurements observed over time containing noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimated values for the current measurement using the Kalman algorithm.
